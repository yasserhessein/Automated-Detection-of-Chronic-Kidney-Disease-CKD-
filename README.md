*"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can result from various factors, including tumors, cysts, and kidney stones. Tumors have the potential to cause significant harm to essential organs, while kidney stones develop from solid deposits in the digestive tract. Early and precise diagnosis is crucial to prevent damage to glands, spinal cells, and other vital organs. This paper introduces an automated system for CKD detection utilizing a CNN-BiLSTM model. The CNN component extracts deep features from CT images, while the BiLSTM leverages its temporal sequence learning capabilities, employing four optimizers: Adam, Adamax, SGD, and RMSprop. During implementation, the proposed system achieved a test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.84% using the Adam optimizer. Experimental results demonstrate the system's potential to assist doctors in diagnosing CKD accurately and determining appropriate treatments to reduce patient mortality rates. Although the current dataset has validated the system's effectiveness, incorporating a larger and more diverse dataset in the future could enhance its performance. This research signifies a promising step toward advancing automated CKD diagnosis."*
